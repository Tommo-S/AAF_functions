Changes
-reviveMarkers.sqf
Markers should show in ACE spectate now
Removed name from revive markers. Seems silly given we have ACE nametags, shacktac, Zeus has the player icon with name, ACE spectate has its own icon for revive.

-reviveMarkerUpdater.sqf
Fixed typo, revivemarker updater would always check the player's own bleeding. Wasn't an issue before as only players were expected to have the marker, and players updated their own, but potentially with AI having revive markers that's not going to work.

Known Issues
-Revive markers in singleplayer, FPS dropped like a stone when they're active it.
-Can't replicate, but I've had a report of a revive marker appearing over a dead player briefly. They went down, ragdolled, the marker appeared, was there for a bit. I suspect it's network related.


TODO
Fiddle with ReviveMarker positioning, get it closer to the unit so it isn't so high above.
Also try and get it closer to their chest/neck.
